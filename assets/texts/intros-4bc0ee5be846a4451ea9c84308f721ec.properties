S01E01 = Episode 01: Truth about Roswell\n\nFueled by their hungry for power against the Soviets, they want to capture you, alive or dead, no matter what the cost.\nOf course, you have no weapons, as their use on research Ships is prohibited by interstellar conventions. Bad luck. However, you are not completely defenseless ...\nIn addition, with some modifications, you can put into use a wormhole generator  that will teleport you to somewhere and to sometime (at least if you manage to survive until then, to be precise, otherwise you'll be back to the starting point). It probably goes without saying that the use of this is even more strictly prohibited by interstellar conventions, but necessity breaks law, isn't it?
